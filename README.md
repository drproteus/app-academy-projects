# App Academy Projects (2014-2015)

I attended App Academy in NYC during the Fall 2014 cohort.
It was an incredible experience and I'll be forever grateful
to the instructors and fellow students during that time.

Unfortunately, I nuked many of the project repos some years later.
Fortunately, I recently happened upon the [Software Heritage Archive](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/)
which happened to have archives of many of the repositories that had been deleted.

This archives those as well as pointing to submodules for sources that were preserved.

## The Projects
* [protophoto](./protophoto) - Ruby on Rails Flickr clone with EXIF processing and geolocation.
* [asteroids](./asteroids) - HTML canvas asteroids game.
